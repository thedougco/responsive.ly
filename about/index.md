We live in a [multi-screen world](http://www.google.com/think/research-studies/the-new-multi-screen-world-study.html). The many and varied screens we use to browse the internet serve as our primary tools for reading and writing information. We move simultaneously and sequentially between desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and even game consoles to investigate and accomplish things on the web. 

If you make things for the web, you know the multi-screen world changes how we build. We must adjust how we plan, prototype, design, develop. The variety and differences of devices also changes our interfaces; keyboard and mouse are giving way to touchscreens, gestural input, and voice activation. 

This site is about building the web for change both responsively and responsibly. We maintain it with three principles in mind:

1. **Curate.** Everything is too much.  
2. **Keep it human.** The web is filled with delightful personalities. Why not bring these personalities to the surface?  
3. **Be inclusive.** There is an wealth of content out there specifically for developers. We want to appeal to the entire web community, including content strategists and designers.
