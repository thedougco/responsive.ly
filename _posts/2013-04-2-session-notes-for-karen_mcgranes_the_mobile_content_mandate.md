**Lessons Learned from DEC**  
At their peak, Digital Equipment Corporation was the world's second largest computer corporation. Second only to IBM. They were good at making mainframes. DEC began to shift their model toward mini-computers like the PDP-4. With smaller minicomputers, individual departments could focus on their own computing tasks.

The PDP-8 was DEC’s breakthrough model. It was sold back in the 70s and 80s. Karen shows a picture of Ken Olsen, their CEO. He has overseen decades of growth and new products and services.<!-- more -->

1988, DEC began making VAX-11 computers using VT100 graphics processing terminals. DEC was sitting on top of the world. They had no reason to believe their entire business would be destroyed by one of these *cheap pieces of crap.* Karen shows some of the first generation PCs.

Compared to a VAX machine PCs were like a child’s toy. 

**DEC: a timeline**  

*1988*  
DEC is the world's second largest computer company
They are the second largest employer in MASS

*1990*  
Posts its first quarterly loss

*1991* 
They post their first full-year loss

They lost money for 5 out of the next 7 years

*1998*  
Acquired by Compaq, out of business… gone. Purchased by a manufacturer who made PCs, those cheap pieces of garbage.

No way they could have foreseen this right?

>--The New Yorker

**Disruptive innovation happens on the low end**  
When a cheap product gets introduced, it may not be better on any spectrum of quality. But the affordability creates a new market with a group of people who could not afford it before. Historically, this happens time and time again.

**The radio analogy**  
Imagine in the 1930s you bought a big, expensive  furniture radio because you imagine it is a decorative heirloom. Then you see your teenager buy a transistor radio just because they take it to the beach. Wasn’t the point of a radio the quality of sound? Not exactly. 

The transistor radio created a new market for people who could not afford a high-end radio and allowed them to take it anywhere. The low-end transistor radio was the disruptor, then over the next decade companies began manufacturing better and better radios. The first maker of transistor radios? Sony.

**The printer analogy**  
Offset printers are the best total cost per quality. Isn’t that the whole point of a printer? Digital printers changed this. It gave more audiences cheaper access to something of lower quality.

**Photography**  
The digital photo market did exactly the same thing. Not only did it wipe away expectations for quality of film, it wiped away the camera market. People buy phones instead of camera. Instagram: that is disruptive innovation.

**Personal Computers**  
We are in the midst of another form of disruptive innovation. Today, mobile phones are disrupting the market for their mobile

Clayton Christiansen, who came up with the the theory of disruptive innovation, predicted the iPhone would fail, because it was not low end. He saw a fancy phone, not something that would create a new market.

**The Digital Divide**  
As professionals it’s easy for us to forget the population that does not have internet access.  
 
- 20% of Americans have no internet access  
- 35% have no internet access at home  
- 29% of black Americans have no internet access  
- 32% of hispanic Americans have no internet access  
- 49% have no broadband access at home  
- 38% of low-income Americans have no internet access  
- 59% of low-income Americans have no broadband access at home  
- 46% of Americans with a disability have no internet access  
- 59% have no broadband access at home  
- 57% of Americans without a high school diploma have no internet  access  
- 88% have no broadband access at home  

Conversely, 88% of Fortune 500 companies only put job postings on the internet.

Lots of people out there have no broadband access. But mobile ownership is on the rise.

**Mobile ownership**  

- 85% of US citizens had mobile phones in 2009  
- 88% of US citizens had mobile phones in 2012  
- 31% of US citizens used mobile internet in 2009  
- 55% of US citizens used mobile internet in 2012  

The largest growth of people who are getting smartphones is people who do NOT have internet access in any other venue.

**The mobile only user**  
This is the user who mostly or primarily accesses the internet through a phone. 

**Mobile-only demographics**  

- Of 55% of Americans who use their mobile phones to go online, 
- 31% only or mostly use the internet on mobile.  
- 43% of low only or mostly use the internet on mobile  
- 42% Hisppanic  of low only or mostly use the internet on mobile    
- 51% of low only or mostly use the internet on mobile  

Mobile was the final frontier in the access revolution. 

**Missed opportunities for the mobile-only user**  

- 21% of large advertisers have a mobile website.  
- 16% of consumer brands have a mobile strategy.  
- 20% B2B brands have a mobile strategy  

Karen shows a Bank of America example where you can only perform three tasks. Her point is that three use cases are extremely limiting for a mobile-only user. 

Karen points out several examples, including United, as mobile experiences where information is vexingly out of reach. We are treating mobile users as second-class citizens because we are not providing them with the same utility and information. Mobile-only users get a watered-down internet.

*This isn't good enough.* All of our users deserve a better experience. There are three things you can be doing right now to improve the mobile experience.

## 1. You need a content strategy for mobile

Karen shamelessly points us to [her book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/content-strategy-for-mobile).

Three things you can do now to improve the mobile experience for all users.

**Know your workflow.**  
Identify the authors. Identify the problems with content generation and curation. 

**Web and mobile are not separate**  
Many companies are treating these two things as separate. The workflow is cumbersome. Karen points to a Comcast example where they have forked mobile and desktop web. *No forking way.* It’s not a strategy if you can’t maintain it. It’s not a long-term solution, especially for teams who are stretched to capacity.


## 2. Write better

One of my biggest pet peeves in mobile is the idea of “how to write for mobile” or “how to write for a mobile audience.” 

There’ s no such thing. There is only good writing. Write shorter sentences, write clearly, use headings and bullet points and avoid jargon. 

The American Cancer Society, when exploring their mobile strategy, found that the population who was more likely to leave cancer untreated was the same as the mobile-only audience.

> --David Balcom, American Cancer Society  

Example:  
[American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/)  

Their mobile site succeeds because they have great content. Their content made the leap to mobile well for this reason. *Good content transcends platform.*

**Chunking your blobs**  

- Which content should we include (or exclude)?
- Should long pages be broken into shorter ones?
- Will it work to reuse headings as links?
- Will it work to reuse body copy for summaries?
- What fallbacks can we provide if our desktop content just doesn’t work?

*Responsive design won’t fix your content problems.*  
Karen points to an example of designing a system of image crops for a variety of screen sizes. Content can work in the same way.  Instead, in many cases, we simply use ellipses in mobile.

Plan for length, summaries.  

Karen points out Blockbuster’s flawed mobile experience, how they simply truncated summaries. She compares it Netflix, where they’ve planned for mobile summaries.

She compares Verizon’s mobile content to Comcast’s mobile content. The Comcast version has summaries connected to navigation. She points out this is a vast improvement, particularly for mobile users. This is an example of developing a flexible system.

## 3. Don’t create content for a specific context

Instead, design a system of content that is meant to deploy content to the broadest number of display systems.

We don’t get to decide where people access our content. They–users–do.

Disruptive technologies eventually get good. Or they redefine what good means. Cheap devices change how you think about what good is. Your values around why the desktop is good are the same values held by the people who made furniture radio or manufactured film. Access to new markets changes what it means to interact with content.

Do mobile right. Right from the start. Mobile is going to change everything.
