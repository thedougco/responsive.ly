###Live, Online, and Happening Tomorrow
It’s a little late in the game to be posting about this event, but better later than never, right? [Environments for Humans](http://environmentsforhumans.com/) is hosting their [second annual online, live responsive web design summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/responsive-web-design-summit/#.UWyJO4Luf5o) starting tomorrow, April 16th through Thursday, April 18th 2013.

The speaker lineup seems to focus on [practitioners rather than theorists](http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2013/04/getting-stronger-through-stress-making-black-swans-work-for-you.html). Regardless of the methodology behind the speaker selection, it’s a kick-ass lineup. Among the names you might recognize:    
- Dave Olsen [(@dmolsen)](https://twitter.com/dmolsen), Author, Developer and Project Manager  
- Dan Mall [(@danmall)](https://twitter.com/danielmall), Founder and Designer at SuperFriendly  
- Sara Wachter-Boettcher [(@sara_ann_marie)](https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie), Author, Content Strategist and Editor at A List Apart  
- Ben Callahan [(@bencallahan)](https://twitter.com/bencallahan), President of Sparkbox and Host of the Build Responsively Workshops  
- Erik Runyon [(@erunyon)](http://www.weedygarden.net/), Managing Director of Interactive at Notre Dame, Speaker, and Co-founder of this site  

You’ll likely recognize a few other #RWD superstars including Trent Walton and Dave Rupert from [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/).

My own professional development time is at capacity for the year due to the birth of my [twin boys](https://vine.co/v/bpmtiJBIEUe?fb_action_ids=10200969264183627&fb_action_types=vine-app%3Apost&fb_source=aggregation&fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582), but if you have the time and the budget I suggest you [head on over to the RWD Summit site and buy yourself a ticket](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/responsive-web-design-summit/#.UWyPN4Luf5p). You can purchase by the day or choose to attend  the entire three-day extravaganza.
