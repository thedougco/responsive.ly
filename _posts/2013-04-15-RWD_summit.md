It’s a little late in the game to be posting this, but better later than never, right? [Environments for Humans] is hosting their [second annual online, live responsive web design summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/responsive-web-design-summit/#.UWyJO4Luf5o). It runs starting tomorrow, April 16th to Thursday, April 18th 2013.

I can’t say for sure without speaking to the co-chairs but it seems to me their focus is on [practitioners rather than theorists](http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2013/04/getting-stronger-through-stress-making-black-swans-work-for-you.html). Regardless of how they selected their speakers, it looks like a kick-ass lineup, including:  
- Dave Olsen [(@dmolsen)](https://twitter.com/dmolsen), Author, Developer and Project Manager  
- Dan Mall [(@danmall)](https://twitter.com/danielmall), Founder and Designer at SuperFriendly  
- Sara Wachter-Boettcher [(@sara_ann_marie)](https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie), Author, Content Strategist and Editor at A List Apart  
- Ben Callahan [(@bencallahan)](https://twitter.com/bencallahan), President of Sparkbox and Host of the Build Responsively Workshops  
- Erik Runyon [(@erunyon)](http://www.weedygarden.net/), Managing Director of Interactive at Notre Dame, Speaker, and Co-founder of this site  

They remainder of the list features other names from the all-star #RWD list including a couple of the players from [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/).

My own pro-developement time is at capacity for the year due to the birth of my twin boys, but if you have the time and the budget I suggest you [head on over to their site and buy yourself a ticket](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/responsive-web-design-summit/#.UWyPN4Luf5p). You can purchase a ticket by the day or opt for the entire three-day extravaganza.
