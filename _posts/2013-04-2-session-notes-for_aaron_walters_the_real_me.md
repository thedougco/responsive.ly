Mobile first, responsive design, content strategy… the web is changing radically. Despite changes in web design, there are certain tools that remain the same.

## Voice

We all have a unique voice and it connects us with one another. It’s our voice we use to entertain people, to create a revolution, to educate people, it’s our voice to give people a new perspective.<!-- more -->

## Storytelling

We tell stories with design, with code, through writing. We’re always telling stories and we’ve been doing it for millennia. 

Twitter is a different kind of campfire. It’s a place to gather, connect, tell stories. Brands are tools. Brands are built to sell things and tell stories. At their best they do tell stories and make people feel they belong.

### BP

BP is a brand with a logo done by [Ogilvy & Mather](http://www.ogilvy.com/). The CEO came to Ogilvy and said he wanted the brand to tell a story about a company thinking about the future, about different methods of power. Ogilvy even proposed that BP rename the company: Beyond Petroleum. 

Do you guys remember [Deepwater Horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon)? Thats a different kind of story. The BP brand, the story of the company concerned with sustainability, was ruined in seconds. The actions were disconnected from the story.

### Vitamin Water

Vitamin water has a story, a brand and a voice, but it contains so much sugar. It represents a difference between the product and the story.

### Bank of America

Disconnect between midwestern, rolling-fields image they are presenting and the actions they took. 

## Dishonest design

The point here is that a lot of smart designers worked on these brands to create something *dishonest.*  

[Dieter Ramms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) came up with a list of tenets, and one of them was
> “Good design is honest. It does not attempt to manipulate consumers with promises that cannot be kept.”

[Simple](https://simple.com/) is an example of an honest brand. They basically work on improving the experience for a customer.

Ways they do this:

- They don't charge overdraft fees.  
- Pass phrases, a more human version of passwords. They solved a security and a usability problem.  
- Safe-to-spend: they have a number that you can spend based on your current balance and outstanding charges.  
- Map of all transactions with help in direct proximity. 

## Kindnesses translate into trust

All of these finishes are small… *but they are small kindnesses.* Did they have to use design to solve this? No, but it adds up. 

Kindnesses translate into trust.  

### Raleigh Denim as an example of craft

>Make better things in a better way.  
>--Raleigh Denim  

Raleigh Denim uses old machines to manufacture products. They choose old machines. They don’t hire cheap labor. when they make jeans, they hand stamp them. They make 200 jeans every couple of weeks. The founders sign the inside of the jeans. They’ve made something better in a better way.

In an age of access where you can get anything, what we really prize is something that is handmade, unique, just for us, special.

## Other examples of craft:

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/mobile) – the detail put into the illustration, the custom drop shadows below the illustrations, the demonstration of craft… suggests quality behind the service.

Compare Dropbox to [Box](https://www.box.com/). Box is a good service. It doesn’t communicate the same thing. It doesn’t feel unique. 

This is a comparison between good and great. When we live in a world of access, you have to be great.

## Craft as a demonstration of human presence

The difference with Dropbox is there is a demonstration of human presence. That presence is called *personality.* 

The interesting thing about personality is Steven Pinkster 

>Much of the variation in personality-about fifty percent-has genetic causes  
> Steven Pinker, How the mind works  

Personality is an important way of connecting to people. Personality is essential. It is not an option

##The four benefits of personality in design  
 
### 1. Standing out
Example: [Hipmunk](https://www.hipmunk.com/)

### 2. Emotion & memory
Dopamine, the pleasure chemical, helps people remember. 

### General Electric

[General Electric](http://www.ge.com/) has managed to succeed with storytelling. They make the content about people, not about products.

## 3. Find your tribe
> "Human beings can't help it. We just need to belong."  
> --Seth Godin  

Tribes have the power to include. Tribes also has the power to exclude. Tribes say both “we are this, and we are not that.”  But this is important because when you design for everyone, you design for no one. 

Examples:  

- [LGBT Museum](http://nationallgbtmuseum.org/#/home/) –  is personal, real, and transmits a sense of tribe. Brilliant technology and brilliant storytelling.
- [Adidas All Design](http://www.adidasdesignstudios.com/) – in order to recruit the right people, they demonstrate personality and craftsmanship.
- [Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/jobs/designer.html) – simple, personality-based example of a job posting to attract talent.
- [Beta Brand](http://www.betabrand.com/) – “We write 30 minutes of content for every product.”
- [Brady Williams](http://bradywilliams.co/) – lovely demonstration of human values and craft

As designers, we often ask, who are they? When we should be asking, who are we? In my time at Mailchimp, we've tried to approach each design as a person. We have a list of brand traits

## Mailchimp brand attributes

- Fun but not childish  
- Funny but not goofy  
- Powerful but not complicated  
- Hip but not alienating  
- Easy but not simplistic  
- Trustworthy but not stodgy  

## Consistent voice, varied tone

Example:  
[Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)  

## Empathy

As designers, we have to be professional empaths.  

>“The most effective design has a narrative thread.”  
>--Kit Heinrichs  

There is no formula for this, but voice is the starting point. Story is the next thing, it is the explanation of how what your selling. Craft is also a thread. These are keys to making something remarkable.  

>“If you're remarkable, it's likely that some people won't like you. The best the timid can hope for is to be unnoticed. Criticism comes to those who stand out.”  
>--Seth Godin  

Focusing who you are as an organization is about finding the real you. And that is the key to being the best you.
