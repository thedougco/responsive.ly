*Notes taken at An Event Apart Seattle on April 2, 2013*

It's 2001. There was something called Ginger on the horizon, or simply “IT.” Jeff Bezos was into “IT.” Bono was into “IT.” 10s of millions of dollars were being poured into “IT.” Maybe bigger than the internet. Finally, in December 2001, “IT” was revealed.

IT was the [Segway](http://www.segway.com/). IT was a complete failure. It's a complete novelty.

**Who did the Segway exclude?**    
- Anyone with children  
- Anyone who needed to transport another human  
- Anyone without 5 or 6 grand to spend  
- Anyone who lives in a harsh climate  
- Anyone who has to carry more than 20 lbs  
- Anyone who has to go more than 5 miles   

**Who was the Segway changing the world for?**   
Affluent singles who live in southern California.

**Why Research?**  
Frequently, there is a gap between your assumptions and the actual world. This gap gets filled with hype, wishful thinking, and most importantly risk.

*User research can increase knowledge and decrease risk.*  

About the Segway, they said, “Cities will be built around this device.”

I love innovation. We don't want facts to inhibit creativity. We want blue-sky thinking. What happens when blue-sky thinking meets reality? Reality wins.

**Objections to research:**  
We don’t have the expertise.

We’re already doing A/B testing. 

*That's not enough.*  

You might remember the [Color App](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/color-app-symbol-of-silicon-valley-excess-will-fade-away/). 

Color described their app as:
> “Advancing the post-PC revolution by inventing new applications that bring people together through proximity, social, and visual presentation.”

One of the design flaws was that it required people to have a critical mass, many people needed to be in the same place at the same time. It also had a very complex UI. They still managed to raise 41M in venture capital. But they flopped.

> “I thought we were going to build a better Facebook, but within 30 minutes I realized, Oh my God, it’s broken. Holy shit! We totally fucked up!!!”   
> --Bill Nguyen, CEO of Color  

**Consider that unmet needs are the right problems to solve.**  
Often, project strategy ends up being driven by politics rather than unmet needs. Don't waste anyone's time or effort on untested assumptions when you don't have to.

Failure is a very expensive way to learn, but user research is not.

What problem are you solving? What is research? It is just asking questions.

Most research starts with a Google query and ends with a Wikipedia page. Assessing credibility is the hard part of this research

**Pure research**  
This is scientific research, and it begins with a question or hypothesis, like why humans sleep. Pure research are the results of questioning and observation, and the results are published in peer research journal. This is science.

**Applied research**  
This is the kind of research Erika is most interested in. Real-word, lighter-weight application of applied techniques. Strict research protocols may be relaxed in order to get to a more casual form of observation in real use cases.

If your research helped you meet your stated goal, it succeeded. 

**Design research**  
This started about thirty years ago. A number of techniques to gather opinions about creative work.

Design research is meant to:  
- Expose patterns  
- Explore reactions  
- Shed light on the unknown  

*Design research is not enough.*  
The real world context in which your design is used is where we should be conducting research. You have to think about the real world. You have to think about your user in the wild. 

**What research is not**  
Research is not asking people what they like. Like is not a part of the critical thinker's vocabulary. Like is subjective, self-reported, and empty. "I like horses! But I'm not going to buy any horses online." 

We should not ask people what they hate. Hate is subjective.

Research is not a political tool.

(Applied) research is not SCIENCE. Avoid conversation about statistical significance. Focus on getting useful insight.

**What research is** 
Research is one very simple process:
Form questions, consider / observe / interview, analyze data. 

Research generates insights that informs ongoing work and leads to success.  

Forming good questions is the most imporant activity of all.  

**Good questions to inform research are:**  
- simple  
- specific  
- answerable  
- practical  

Critical thinking isn’t always popular. It challenges assumptions. Critical thinking is:  
1. Disciplined  
2. Self-correcting  
3. Clear  
4. Logical  

Interviews are the core of user research. Talking to people who represent the core of your user base. Our fear of this is that we don't want to be limited by what people say. We don't want it  to inhibit our creativity. But we have to let go of this and get out and talk to other people.  

Questions help us think critically. Observation is an applied research technique.  

**For good interviews**  
1. Know your question  
2. Warm up  
3. Shut up: interviewing is not talking, it's listening  

Out of your comfort zone and into theirs. Through research we acquire raw materials. Notes, videos, photographs. What's an observation in this context? A reported behavior. Here we begin to observe emergent behaviors.  

##Research Topics  

**Organizational research**  
1. Requirements  
2. Politics  
3. Workflow  
4. Capabilities  
5. Goodwill  

You will find that people work together in ways that are not represented in an org chart. It's critical to get people into one-on-one conversations.  

**Four d’s of design ethnography research**  
1. Deep dive: getting to know a handful of individuals  
2. Daily life: observing people in real-world environments  
3. Data analysis: critical thinking around recorded data  
4. Drama: pulling out stories and human interest from observations   

##Recruiting  

*Tool:*  
[Ethnio](http://ethn.io/)  

**Incentives**  
It’s critical to use incentives to reduce bias. If we only recruit friends we stack the research outcomes. Incentives bring in a bigger pool of people.

Personas, scenarios, focus groups are tools of ethnographic research.

**Focus groups are not research.**  
> “Even when the subjects are well selected, focus groups are merely the source of ideas that need to be researched.“  
> --Robert K. Merton, Creator Focus Groups!  

Competitive research = how else might your target customer solve the same problem. 

How is what you’re offering better than nothing? Remember that people are lazy and forgetful. Your target customers have to love you more than they hate change.

Quantitative methods. Quantitative methods is about measuring things. A/B testing will never tell you why something performs better than another. It only tells you that one thing is performing better than another.

Our field benefits when more people ask more questions and help come up with the answers. We must not reinforce the notion that research is hard and expensive and takes a long time. 

Erika promotes her book: [Just Enough Research](http://www.abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research)

Just enough is different for every project and organization. It depends on the context.  

Cultivate a desire to be proven wrong, quickly, and at the lowest cost.
