*Notes taken at An Event Apart Seattle 2013*

**I. Thou shalt entertain**  
We do a lot of work to make sure out sites are accessible, professional, readable… but one of the things that we forget is that we’re in the entertainment business too. If sites don't entertain, they are not engaging. We're competing for attention, the more we do to entertain, the better.
Example: [Panic](http://panic.com)

“Hi” is kind of like “welcome to our website. What good is it?”
Jeffrey points out the success of Panic’s skeuomorphic icons. They go for cute and fun, and the touch/hover events give you more information. It sets a tone that is fun, conversational, friendly, and it makes the software loved vs. other software that is equally as good. Panic succeeds because it has such a fun ambient connection to users. 

“Nothing kills a bad product faster than bad advertising. Entertainment all the way down.”

Jeffrey points out the Alistapart.com illustrations, specifically the brilliant Kevin Cornell illustrations are used to add a level of culture and personality to the site. “We add interest with the illustrations. We’re shining our own shoes. The headline and the visual play off each other”

Jeffrey points out the work of James Thurber as an illustrator. James Thurber wasn’t a great illustrator but they brought a warmth, humanity, and softness to his stories that a more professional style of illustration might not have. 

Jeffrey points out how ineffective stock photos are compared to ”crappy” illustrating. Why not claymation, taking your own photos? Part of entertainment is about thinking about how to be different.

The RDIO site does not have a good 404 error page and that is a missed opportunity.

Bad example of 404:  
[RDIO.com](http://www.rdio.com/jerkcity/)

Good example of 404:  
[Tom Muldair](http://www.ndp.ca/tommulcair/jerkcity)

Example of going to far:  
Joomla example with overdone, hyperbolic Yoda message.

Sites with personality:  
[GNU foods](http://www.gnufoods.com/)
Jeffrey points out the talking bird, the ”Gnusletter,” pictures of soldiers in Afghanistan eating fiber bars as examples of personality.

[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)  
Has intertwining copy excerpts such as greetings in another language. What Zeldman refers to as ”Little, delightful touches.”

**II. Test everything (including assumptions)**  
Examples:  
[Brad Frost's Post on Testing Mobile Devices](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/)

[Remote Preview](http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/) a tool for previewing a site on multiple devices simultaneously.

Jeffrey talks about how they tested the A List Apart redesign. They conducted a series of conversations with readers. He points out how putting alt text on images would have meant repetition of text to screen readers, so they used the null alt tag to eliminate redundancy.

Meta-testing the testing assumption:  
[Testing the assumption that testing assumptions is good](http://alistapart.com/column/looking-beyond-user-centered-design)

Milton Glaser was asked to explain design and he said ”I move stuff around until it looks right.”

**III. Iterate**  
Jeffrey shows iteration of design of A List Apart as a sequence.  ”How far can you go redesigning a brand? It depends and this is why iteration is important.”

Jeffrey points out that little text links at the top of A List Apart articles were more effective than graphic links at the bottom. They initially assumed this was a bad thing, but discovered people really do like to tweet things before reading them. They saw a huge uptake in engagement in Twitter by having the small social media text links at the top. Instead of trying to educate readers not to ”tweet before reading, we let them.”

**IV. Thou shalt ship**  
”One of the saddest things is to work on getting a web site or app to make it perfect and someone comes out with a crappy version of the app that succeeds because it was first.”

It doesn’t matter if how good you are if you don’t ship. And if you take too long someone else will beat you. Jeffrey points out the NYtimes.com redesign and how it is exposed and iterative.

”We ship and keep working. That’s the web.”

**V. Engage thy community**  
”The most important you have besides your content and your proprietary apps are the people who love what you do.” Sometimes you can break that engagement.

Jeffrey discusses the Facebook acquisition of Instagram and the draconian change in [terms of service](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/what-instagrams-new-terms-of-service-mean-for-you/).

Example:  
[Monotype](http://www.monotype.com/) 

People don’t love Monotype the same way they Love Hoefler & Frere-Jones or House Industries. Happy Cog advised Monotype to boost engagement by soliciting content from their community

Example:  
[Happy Cog posts](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/the-beauty-of-the-blank-slate)
They did away with comments and allowed twitter and blog post embeds. This dramatically boosted engagement and gathered more comments.

[A List Apart commenting embeds](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/embeddable-comments-yes-please)


**VI. Love thy user as thyself**  
“Be good to people. Meet them where they are.”

**VII.**  
“Remember the content and keep it holy. This is not the same thing as content is king (or queen).”

Jeremy Keith coined the term “content first.” 

Examples:  
[Jeremy Keith’s Content First](http://adactio.com/journal/4523/)
[Mark Boulton’s A Richer Canvas](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/a-richer-canvas)
[Jeffrey Zeldman’s Design is Copy is Design](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/12/05/design-is-copy-is-design/)
[EDUniverse](http://eduniverse.org/content-first-jeffrey-zeldman-edui-2011)
[Content Strategy for Mobile](http://www.abookapart.com/products/content-strategy-for-mobile)

**VIII. Ignore workflow at your peril**  

**IX. Thou shalt prioritize**  

Github has in “issues” tool for prioritizing. To a boss, everything is an emergency. Sometimes we need a tools to help team members visualize priorities.

Examples:  
[Kick Ass Kickoff Meetings](http://alistapart.com/article/kick-ass-kickoff-meetings)

**X. To thine own self be true**  
“Don't change what you are in the hopes it will make you more popular. The third time I was arrested, I figured this out“ --Jeffrey Zeldman

**XI. Don't be a lemming!**  
“Think for yourself. Thank you!“ --Jeffrey Zeldman
