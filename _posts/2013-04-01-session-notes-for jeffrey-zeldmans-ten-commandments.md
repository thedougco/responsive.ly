*Notes taken at An Event Apart Seattle 2013*

**I. Thou shalt entertain**  
We do a lot of work to make sure out sites are accessible, professional, readable… but one of the things that we forget is that we’re in the entertainment business too. If sites don't entertain, they are not engaging. We're competing for attention, the more we do to entertain, the better.
Example: [Panic](http://panic.com)

“Hi” is kind of like “welcome to our website. What good is it?”
Jeffrey points out the success of Panic’s skeuomorphic icons. They go for cute and fun, and the touch/hover events give you more information. It sets a tone that is fun, conversational, friendly, and it makes the software loved vs. other software that is equally as good. Panic succeeds because it has such a fun ambient connection to users. 

“Nothing kills a bad product faster than bad advertising. Entertainment all the way down.”

Jeffrey points out the Alistapart.com illustrations, specifically the brilliant Kevin Cornell illustrations are used to add a level of culture and personality to the site. “We add interest with the illustrations. We’re shining our own shoes. The headline and the visual play off each other”

Jeffrey points out the work of James Thurber as an illustrator. James Thurber wasn’t a great illustrator but they brought a warmth, humanity, and softness to his stories that a more professional style of illustration might not have. 

Jeffrey points out how ineffective stock photos are compared to ”crappy” illustrating. Why not claymation, taking your own photos? Part of entertainment is about thinking about how to be different.

The RDIO site does not have a good 404 error page and that is a missed opportunity.

Bad example of 404:  
[RDIO.com](http://www.rdio.com/jerkcity/)

Good example of 404:  
[Tom Muldair](http://www.ndp.ca/tommulcair/jerkcity)

Example of going to far:  
Joomla example with overdone, hyperbolic Yoda message.

Sites with personality:  
[GNU foods](http://www.gnufoods.com/)
Jeffrey points out the talking bird, the ”Gnusletter,” pictures of soldiers in Afghanistan eating fiber bars as examples of personality.

[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)  
Has intertwining copy excerpts such as greetings in another language. What Zeldman refers to as ”Little, delightful touches.”
