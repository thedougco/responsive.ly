Whether you believe responsive [web design is 95% typography](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/) or [99.9% typography](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-responsive-web-will-be-99-9-typography/), it's tough to get away from the web design community's 
current focus on the [the reading experience](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/18/designing-reading-experience/).

Viljami Salminen [(@viljamis)](https://twitter.com/viljamis), a Finnish Designer, has a blog post up about a “content-out” prototyping method beginning with typography. Instead of using a traditional wireframing process, Viljami suggests designers wait until there is real content (or something close to it) to work with and begin with a typographic style preview to share with clients.<!-- more -->

How content and language are used should shape the typographic tools necessary to do the job right. In many traditional prototyping methods, designers work with latin substitutes for real content or a substitute such as the recent [BLOKK font](http://blokkfont.com/). Both latin and the block font add layers of indirection to prototyping. The absence of real content means prototypes can't accurately communicate character length of headlines, blurbs and other elements of copy. Without real content, a prototype cannot demonstrate how well typographic style will suit editorial voice. Viljami's method solves for these problems.

A typography-based prototyping model is one that puts the reading experience first. Before we ask clients to make decisions about layout, color and finishes (as is common with other popular prototyping methods including [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)), we could be asking clients to make decisions about one of the most important aspects of web design: *how the content will look and how it will read*. I'd much rather have my clients focused on clarity, legibility and typographic character than splitting hairs about hairline rules and layout, especially at the beginning of a project.

Viljami lists several different resources for typography-first prototyping. I've been using [Typecast](http://typecast.com/) since the beta and have tried my first “content-out” prototype for a client. The prototype worked well but that it did require an explanation of the methodology. As the web changes and our methods change, we must be prepared to communicate the *why* and *how* of these changes to our clients.
