Whether you believe responsive [web design is 95% typography](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/) or [99.9% typography](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-responsive-web-will-be-99-9-typography/), it's tough to get away from the the current focus on the [the reading experience](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/18/designing-reading-experience/) in the web design community. 

Viljami Salminen [(@viljamis)](https://twitter.com/viljamis), a Finnish Designer, has an excellent post up a "content-out" prototyping method that begins with typography. Instead of using a traditional wireframing process, Viljami suggests designers wait until there is real content (or something close to it) to work with, and begin with a typographic style preview.

Two things strike me about Viljami's process: first, that it makes so much sense to begin with content because how content and language are used shape the typographic tools necessary to do the job right. In many traditional prototyping methods, designers work with latin substitutes for real content or a substitute such as the recent [BLOKK font](http://blokkfont.com/). The absence of real content means prototypes can't communicate character length of headlines, blurbs, or body copy accurately or demonstrate how well typographic character will match editorial voice. Viljami's method solves for those problems.

The second thing that makes sense in a type-first prototyping model is that it is a process that puts the reading experience first. Before we ask clients to make decisions about layout, color and finishes (as is common with other popular prototyping methods including [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)), we could be asking clients to make decisions about one of the most important aspects of web design: how well sites will read. I don't know how you feel about this but I'll offer a point a view: I'd rather have my clients focused on clarity, legibility, and typographic character than splitting hairs about hairline rules and drop shadows.
