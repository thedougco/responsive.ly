*Notes taken at An Event Apart Seattle on April 1, 2013*

Over the past couple of years, Luke W. has been doing a couple of things. He has been helping big companies with their mobile strategies, but he has also been working on his own small company. This session is based on his own micro- and macro- experiences.

Luke W. Lives in Silicon Valley and has some interesting neighbors: Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Google, and YouTube. Why is he giving us the map of “internet places by Luke W.'s house?” What do they have in common?<!-- more -->

The companies near Luke W.'s house are the top sites in the US by time spent per user as of September 2012, in this order:  

1. Facebook  
2. Yahoo  
3. AOL  
4. Google
5. YouTube  

Another thing these sites all have in common is that they offer write/read experiences. They don't work unless people add (write) content to them.

“The original thing I wanted to do was make the web a place where we could all meet and read & write.” --Tim Berners-Lee

When we look at the top worldwide sites we see the same thing. The top sites are write/read experiences. Once again, they don't work unless people write content to them.

*How it's all going mobile*  

- 67% of monthly Facebook users on mobile  
- 60% of all twitter users on mobile  
- 4x mobile in 18 months on YouTube  

Facebook Monthly non-mobile Active Traffic is static from Q3 2010 to Q4 2012. However their mobile growth has been linear and growing the entire time. In 2011, their mobile traffic eclipsed non-mobile traffic. Examples include:  

- 23% growth of mobile only Facebook users in 3 months  
- 30% of Facebook India users are mobile only  
- 40% of all tweets are created on mobile in 2011  
- 3 hours of video per second uploaded on YouTube mobile  
- $13B mobile commerce on E-Bay in 2012 vs. $4B in 2011  

##  Time spent using mobile apps

- 43% games  
- 10% entertainment  
- 26% social networking  
- 12% shopping  
- 11% accomplishing  

## It's a read/write mobile web

In any read write social media pyramid, the breakdown works something like this: 
 
- 1% of users are content creators  
- 10% of users are content curators  
- 100% of users are consumers

## Tuning the design process for creation and curation

Luke W. points out the many iterations Facebook went through to encourage content curation / creation. It was a design process iterated to get content into the platform. YouTube went through a similar process. Focusing on making this part of the process easy is how social services have grown.

## If we believe it's a write/read web…

Then how do we design for mobile creation?

## Designing for the write/read web: one-handed use

Polar app was designed for one thumb use. It was designed to allow someone to vote on ten polls in under 30 seconds. It was also designed to allow a user to create a poll in under 30 seconds. But why did they design for the 30-second read/write experience?

“What we need to do to design is to look at the extremes. The middle will take care of itself.”
--Dan Formosa

…mobile represents an extreme design constraint.

The home and the office represent more distracted cell phone use. When you design for single thumb use it changes how you design. 

Luke points out a Google flight example where actions are pre-populated. A simple series of buttons avoids typing and helps guide audiences. Smarter defaults and suggestions can help users avoid typing. These practices allow us to accommodate for the single-thumb and the single-eye user. Sliders also make the design more thumb-friendly.  

## Designing for the write/read web: visually engaging

When we keep the keyboard away, it forces us to be smarter about interfaces.  

Examples:  
Luke points out Snapchat as an example digital impermanence.  

Luke W. points out Naver's Line – the visual chat interface.  It's sort of Emoji icons on steroids.  

“Images rule on mobile.”

*What about performance?*  
Web performance can't be ignored but it can't be looked at as a barrier for making the web less visual.

Things to think about:

- Image optimization–half size/better quality  
- Compressive images  

We have to think about experiences that are both highly visual and respect web performance.  

## Designing for the write/read web: focused flows

Creativity is caring enough about something to keep working it until you've made it better.  

Luke W. points out how Boingo cut 11 input fields in their mobile view and saw a 34% increase in conversations and a 53% decrease in sign-up times.  

Hotel Tonight is another example of this. They have a touch-based input that allows someone to book 3 taps and a swipe. Their design has no filters, no input fields. It's a simple model that picks up the cheapest hotels near you.

In this case, the competitive advantage isn't the form design. It's the simplicity of the model.

## Designing for the write/read web: just-in-time actions

Instead of forcing tutorials up front, give in-context tips. This technique shows up in the Polar app design. Tips are shown only when needed and are not persistent.

In the Polar app, the top menu is not visible as you scroll down. When you scroll back to the top, the menu shows up. It's an example of a just-in-time interface element.

**Cross-device usage: how do we design for mobile content creation?**
How do we create write/read multi-device creation?

1. *Access* – what #rwd helps us accomplish, access to content on all devices  
2. *Flow* – allowing processes to flow seamlessly between devices. Using a browser synced to devices, you can begin a transaction on one device and finish it on another.  
3. *Control* – one device can tell another device what to do, examples is authentication from one device to the next and QR codes  
4. *Push* – instead of having one device control another, one device can push data to the next. E-Bay allows a user to make an entry on one device, and enter a photo from a mobile device.  

It's a write/read ~~mobile~~ multi-device web.
