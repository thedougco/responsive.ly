Recently [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) unveiled a [free public preview version of Edge Reflow](http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/), a desktop application for prototyping and designing webpages responsively. 

One of Edge Reflow’s limitations is a common one for WYSIWYG editors: 
> Adobe Product Manager Jacob Surber tells us his goal with Reflow “is to help designers design within the constraints of the web to communicate their intent, but not to tell developers how to build the site.” Surber went on, detailing that what Reflow generates “is not production code.” [(source: The Next Web)](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/02/14/adobe-launches-responsive-design-app-reflow-updates-dreamweaver-edge-animate-and-edge-code/)

Enter [Webflow](http://webflow.com/). Earlier this week Webflow founders Vlad [(@callmevlad)](https://twitter.com/callmevlad) and Sergie Magdadlin [(@thesergie)](https://twitter.com/thesergie), unveiled [a partially functional live demo](http://playground.webflow.com/) of the new service.

The Webflow demo shows off many of the same features as Edge Reflow, but is a browser-based web app. Although the export feature isn’t functional yet, the site claims code export options are production-ready code with a toggle for CSS, SCSS, SASS, and LESS. The Webflow UI also shows off a pattern library and an outline view to demonstrate how styles are nested. 

Do I believe Webflow going to replace the need for hand coding? No way. But it could be a useful tool for rapid prototyping or style generation, particularly for designers who aren't deeply schooled in CSS. It’s another tool for designing in the browser, a methodology that is increasingly popular. The fact that Webflow currently provides some features Edge Reflow doesn’t currently offer may encourage Adobe to step up their game.
