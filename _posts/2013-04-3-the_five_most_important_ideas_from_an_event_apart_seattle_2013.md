*Based on the sessions at An Event Apart Seattle 2013*

###1. It’s a read/write <del>mobile</del> multi-device web.  

> “What do Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Google, and YouTube… the sites on the web where people spend the most time… have in common? They all offer write / read experiences. They don't work unless people add or write content to them.”  
>--@Luke W. 

*Pay attention to the inversion*  
In [Luke W’spresentation](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for-luke-ws-its-a-read-write-web-mobile-web-at-an-event-apart-seattle/), he deliberately inverts the order of a common phrase on the web, “read/write.” He instead uses a “write/read” order to place primary importance on content generation. The companies and designers who are lowering the barrier for content generation are creating the most used sites and apps on the web. 

*Multiple ways to write, multiple ways to read*  
Josh Clark’s [Desinging for Touch](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for-josh-clarks-designing-for-touch-at-an-event-apart-seattle/) presentation is about how input use cases change dramatically based on human ergonmoics… specifically how we use our thumbs, fingers, and arms to interface with devices. Most of the speakers at the conference touched on the idea of the multi-device web in some way: we’re in a disruptive period of the web, an era of sequential browsing. Desktop-first methodologies are being replaced by strategies and solutions that solve for multiple inputs and multiple screens. 

###2. Good mobile design represents a new, emergent kind of accessibility.  

*We must not short-change the mobile-only users!*  
In her presentation [The Mobile Content Mandate](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for-karen_mcgranes_the_mobile_content_mandate/), Karen McGrane [(@karenmcgrane)](https://twitter.com/karenmcgrane) pointed out some compelling statistics about mobile-only or primarily mobile users in the US:  
>- 20% of Americans have no internet access  
>- 35% have no internet access at home  
>- 38% of low-income Americans have no internet access  
>- 59% of low-income Americans have no broadband access at home  
>- 46% of Americans with a disability have no internet access  
>- 59% have no broadband access at home  
>- 57% of Americans without a high school diploma have no internet  access  

*Mobile-only users are precisely the demographic that needs the web the most*  
[Ethan Marcotte](https://twitter.com/beep) did a presentation called [the Map is not the Territory](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for-ethan_marcottes_the_map_is_not_the_territory_at_an_event_apart_seattle/) on the cognitive divide between problems and solutions in web design. Ethan pointed out how ~90% of new market penetration for mobile is happening in developing countries. In other words, a majority of the world now coming online for the first time using relatively cheap devices. Uses for mobile technology in developing countries aren’t luxuries. Smartphones are being used to do things such as [report corruption](http://www.hatari.co.ke/) or [find water](http://mmaji.wordpress.com/). 

Between these two ideas about underserved demographics and emerging markets we begin to see a theme about the importance of making content and utilities accessible on mobile devices. If we aren’t delivering good content to mobile users, as Karen suggests, we’re *treating the people who need the web the most* as second-class citizens. 

*An emergent kind of web accessibility*  
We might say good mobile design *is* the new accessibility. Because there are other factors for accessibility already in play on the web, its a little more accurate to add some qualifiers. Multi-device web design, specifically in a mobile context, represents a new, emergent kind of accessibility for underserved markets and developing countries. 

###3. Break your assumptions down to the atomic level  

*Disruptive technology calls for disruptive methods*  
Jason Santa Maria[(@jasonsantamaria)](https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria) presented on changing design process to be more nimble. Jason eschews dogma, instead proposing designers think critically about using the right *tool* for the right *audience* in the right *situation.* 

In an era where web design conventions are being disrupted, we can’t rely on assumptions we've made about how process is *supposed* to work. Jason talked about breaking our designs down to the smallest unit, the atomic level: the level of content. Only after beginning to solve the design problems based on raw materials does Jason begin to impose specific tools, such as grid systems. 

*Research as relentless improvement*  
Erika Hall [(@mulegirl)](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for_erika_halls_just_enough_research/) presented on user research as a way of breaking down the assumptions we make about audiences and how they access the web sites we build. She made a powerful point about design: *unmet needs are the right problem to solve.* By using applied research techniques to observe people using sites in real-world situations, we can expose patterns, explore reactions, and shed light on the unknown. 

###4. Empathy is a necessary design skill.  

*Empathy closes the distance between you and your clients*  
>  “Your job isn’t just making shit up. It’s 90% convincing people that the shit you thought up is the right thing to do.”   
>  --Mike Monteiro  

Mike Monteiro [(@mike_ftw)](https://twitter.com/mike_ftw) gave a presentation on skills designers must develop to develop better client relationships. It comes down to empathy.  

> “You are not the sum of your sites, you are the sum of your problem solving.”   
> --Mike Monteiro  

*Explanations > tools*  
Explanations are how to close the distance between your ideas and your client. Jason Santa Maria reinforced this point in his presentation with personal anecdotes. How a designer explains an idea is more important than any tactical tool in the design process.

Aaron Walter [(@aarron)](https://twitter.com/aarron), in his presentation [The Real Me](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for_aaron_walters_the_real_me/), talked about the benefits of inserting personality into design. Personality is a way of establishing empathy between a visitor and a brand. By adding empathy, craft, unique content, and voice into our designs, we can demonstrate values and create the kinds of experiences that set us apart from our competitors.  

###5. Be a unicorn.  
> “Unicorns exist. You can become one!”  
> --Jared Spool  

Work like a horse? *More like work like unicorn.* The unicorn is Jared Spool’s metaphor for the UX generalist: a designer with skills in storytelling, critiquing, sketching, and presenting.  UX generalists are more useful to teams than specialists.

“Don't change what you are in the hopes it will make you more popular. The third time I was arrested, I figured this out.“ --Jeffrey Zeldman

Finally, Jeffrey Zeldman [(@zeldman)](https://twitter.com/zeldman) closed [his session](http://responsive.ly/2013/04/session-notes-for-zeldmans-ten-commandments-of-web-design/) with two commandments dealing with uniqueness:

*The Tenth and Eleventh Commandments of Modern Web Design*
X. To thine own self be true  
*and*
XI. Don’t be a lemming

If you want to be one of the people who builds things that matter, you have to have enough courage to stand apart from the pack.
