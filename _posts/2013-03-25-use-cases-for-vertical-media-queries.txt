Anthony Colangelo [(@acolangelo)](http://www.twitter.com/@acolangelo) [wrote a post about vertical media queries](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/go-vertical/) last week. It  reminded me of Trent Walton's [(@trentwalton)](http://www.twitter.com/@trentwalton) [post from 2012](http://trentwalton.com/2012/01/11/vertical-media-queries-wide-sites/) and in general about a rare beast in responsive design: the height-based media query. 

In general, developers using media queries mostly use width-based ones. Collapsing content to a single column creates a lot of long, skinny mobile sites. At this point, the long, skinny mobile experience is a design pattern we're used to. But height-based queries are an underused way of finessing some of the layout elements that really make more sense when they aren't so tall.

In Anthony's post, he notes the (iPhone landing page](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) uses a vertical media query to set the height of the hero shot. He also asks for reader examples via Twitter submission. I thought this topic could use a little a more depth, so I collected and categorized some different use cases for vertical media queries. Below, I've sorted some of the best Happy Cog user submissions as well as examples I was able to dig up from different posts on the topic from 2012.

##Modifying the size (or viewable area) of large, horizontal graphics

##Tightening line height and/or font size

##Removing height from whitespace between page elements
This is a rare example that alters white space of several elements proportionate to the amount of vertical space available.

##Modifying number of feeds shown on tall, skinny displays

There's a fourth case I can think of for a project I'm working on: changing the number of RSS feed items displayed based on available height. My thought on the project was that as long as a person is only one click or touch away from a full feed, large RSS feeds might get truncated in smaller views to prevent mobile pages from becoming ridiculously long.
