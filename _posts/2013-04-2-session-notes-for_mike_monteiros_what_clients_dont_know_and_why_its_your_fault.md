*Notes taken at An Event Apart Seattle on April 2, 2013*  

You are all in the confidence game. You are always, always convincing someone of something.

Last year I wrote [this book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job). It’s filled with stories about how I screwed things up in the past. It was written with the intent of you taking a lot more responsibility for your job.

You cannot put the ownness of your job on someone else. Today we’ll talk about my favorite people: clients. We'll talk about what they don't know and why it's your fault.

**Mike’s Story**  
I used to live in Austin, Texas. It's incredibly hot and I'm lazy and I used to drive everywhere. I got really fat until I moved to San Fracisco where I got a bike. 

Mike relates a story of going to the store to buy a bike and having too many choices: mountain bikes, hybrids, etc. The abundance of choices made him feel stupid. 

Until a cute, tattooed bearing a close resemblance to Rooney Mara who worked at the bike store decided to rescue Mike from the magnitude of choices. She began asking questions to find out what he needed. Most of all, her ability to express empathy to his situation was what made a difference. She made him feel smarter for talking to her.

At the opposite end of the spectrum is Ticketmaster: their point is to make you feel small. 

Designers, you are in the service industry. You have clients and they need your help. 

How much does a website cost is really a similar question to how much a bike costs. You have to help clients understand. You do this every day. If you do this enough and if you are comfortable  enough with it you may actually forget how to explain it.

Client’s don’t. Most people won't buy design in their lifetime. We get irritated when we have to explain what's become second nature to us. We forget that people don't deal with it every day.

We have no empathy for clients. We forget that helping them through that process is part of our job. We complain about how it interferes with us and our process.We have a long way to go toward empathy.

Every day some designer declares that client services is dead. But where do you think you can go? There’s no place you can go where client services isn’t part of your job. Your job isn’t just making shit up. It’s 90% convincing people that the shit you thought up is the right thing to do.

*If it helps you do your job it's part of your job.*  

-Don’t work with anyone you can’t  
-You can't empathize with someone you don’t respect  
-Put yourself in your clients’ less stylish shoes  

Annoyance is easy. You can’t change how others act. You can change how others behave. 

Clients don’t know when to get a designer involved. When is the right time to engage with you? 

**“They never ask me.”**  
A lot of designers assume that a problem is being solved without them. This is not a design skill. This is designers not asserting themselves. Stop waiting for an invitation to do your job. Stop hoping that people who aren’t designers will start telling you what you need to do your job.

**Clients don't know how to read your portfolio**  
Clients look at our samples. If they don't see something they like off the rack, they are not going to let you take their measurements. Your portfolio is a visual aid for telling stories. The stories about problem solving. 

You don’t sell the suit. You sell the service. You are not the sum of your sites, you are the sum of your problem solving. 

**Client’s don’t know the best way to evaluate a designer**  
Don’t take on a client that isn’t the right match for them. They will pull you away from things you should be working on for months. You are costing the client if you take on a bad fit.

How do the right designers find the right clients? We’ll look at two ways.  

**1. Referrals**  
- These are the best way to start a relationship.  
- It means you’re not an asshole.  
- It means your empathetic to them.  
- Referrals are the most precious commodity you have.  
- Every job you do is a sales pitch for the next job.  

**2. RFPs**  
- RFPs suck. I enjoy building a relationship with clients. There is no better way to measure a way if the fit is good outside of talking to one another. The solution needs to emerge from the two of us working together.  
- RFPs may be a client’s way to tell you they’re scared.  
- RFPs often come from a client not knowing what to do.  

**Finding better client relationships**  
*Learn to say no*  
*Learn to ask possible clients why* don't engage in design   without understanding the problem.  
*Learn to say I don’t know.*  

**Explaining why things cost what they do**  
- putting costs in context for clients  
- not just breaking down pricing, but showing the process  

Do everything in your power to be right, but never be afraid to be wrong. Letting a client tell you how to do your job is stupid. Make sure you can execute on what you're promising.  

**No one is born a good designer**  
Clients are trying to do right by their business. You can roll your eyes at how much they don’t understand or you can roll up your sleeves and help them understand.  

Hope is not a design word, empathy is. The difference between you and your clients is that you know how to explain design. 

**You are not a pixel pusher**  
That is a self-loathing term. We become order takers. We are responsible for the things that we are putting into the world. You need to expect more from the people you hire. Recognize the power you have to make things happen.   

**Everything that’s wrong with design today is your fault.**  
So there should be no question about whose responsibility it is to fix. Thank you, now let’s get to work.
