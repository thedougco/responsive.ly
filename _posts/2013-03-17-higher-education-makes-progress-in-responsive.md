What are colleges and universities doing to catch up to the evolving practice of responsive design? The answer is that #RWD practices vary wildly by institution. 

My friend, colleague and cofounder of this site Erik[(@erunyon)](http://www.twitter.com/@erunyon) maintains [the HigherEd RWD Directory](http://weedygarden.net/highered-rwd-directory/) on his blog, Weedygarden.net. He recently added six new institutions to the list:
+Suffolk University
+Menlo College
+Black Hills State University 
+South Dakota State University
+New Mexico State University
+Maryville State University

The new additions bring the documented number of universities using responsive designs to 85. Since there are [over 6,900 accredited colleges and universities in the United States alone](http://http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/GetDownloadFile.aspx), this list currently represents a very small fraction of a global whole. 

#A Note on Web Performance
[In another post from early 2013](http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/the-numbers-behind-highered-rwd/), Erik notes many of the colleges and universities currently using responsive design have not taken the time to optimize performance for mobile sites.

The takeaway? Higher education at large still has plenty of catching up to do.
