*Skeuomorphia: it's just not cool anymore.*

*These notes were taken at [MakerHaus](http://www.makerhaus.com/) on May 9, 2013 – an event hosted by [IxDA Seattle](http://www.ixdaseattle.org/) + [AIGA Seattle](http://www.aigaseattle.org/)*

Some of the ideas from the talk are covered in [Connecting: the Film](http://connectingthefilm.com/). A team from Microsoft talked to friends (including designers from Twitter, Method, Frog, Microsoft, the School of Visual Arts) about emerging trends in interaction design; excerpts from those interviews were used for the movie.

## Emerging themes in interaction design, as identified in the Connecting: the Film  
1. The internet of things  
2. Screens are everywhere  
3. More natural interfaces  
4. Augmenting our abilities  
5. Building living systems  
6. Adaptive environments  
7. When machines can see  

## Flat Design  
• “Flat design” is a label created by the media, but it is also an emerging trend.  
• “Flat” has a negative connotation (boring).  
• Simple design can be a way of narrowing focus.  
• One thing to beware in “flat” design is too few affordances; the Windows Phone team has worked hard to include motion queues and natural motion as an affordance in simpler interfaces.

## Blurring of the line in devices  
What is a phone? [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/product) products are wearable devices for quantifying data about the self, and they begins to blur the definition of where a phone ends and a device begins: they provide functionality we previously relied on phones for.

## What’s the big deal with flat design?  
• [Metro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_%28design_language%29) is not a static rulebook for Windows, it’s an evolving thing.
• “Flat” design is apparent in Apple industrial design (the cases) but not in Apple iOS / iOS apps.
• [Skeuomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorphic) doesn't help if the original analog object emulated was confusing to begin with.
• Skeuomorphism does not help if the digital version has limitations that do not need to exist in a digital environment.
• [“The desktop”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_desktop) itself is a kind of a skeuomorphic metaphor that has informed how we think about interface design (folders, etc. as an extension).
• Some design elements are meant to be invisible. “The grid is the underwear of the book.” -- Massimo Vignelli

## What did the Microsoft Windows team learn, working on the phone?
• In 2009, the Windows Phone software was strongly skeuomorphic. So were other phone operating systems. Filled with gradients, etc.
• Their plan was to do something completely different. They were going for a timeless look that referenced Swiss design, [International Typographic Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style).  
• Their philosophy is “get rid of the chrome.”
