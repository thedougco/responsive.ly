What are colleges and universities doing to catch up to the evolving practice of responsive design? The answer is that #RWD practices vary wildly by institution. 

Erik Runyon [(@erunyon)](http://www.twitter.com/@erunyon), cofounder of this site maintains [the HigherEd RWD Directory](http://weedygarden.net/highered-rwd-directory/) on his blog, [Weedygarden.net](http://weedygarden.net/). <!-- more -->He recently added six new institutions to the list:  
+ [Suffolk University](http://www.suffolk.edu/)  
+ [Menlo College](http://www.menlo.edu/)  
+ [Black Hills State University](http://www.bhsu.edu/)  
+ [South Dakota State University](http://www.sdstate.edu/)  
+ [New Mexico State University](http://www.nmsu.edu/)  
+ [Maryville State University](http://www.maryville.edu/explore/)  

The new additions bring the documented number of universities using responsive designs to 85. Since there are [over 6,900 accredited colleges and universities in the United States alone](http://http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/GetDownloadFile.aspx), this list currently represents a very small fraction of a global whole. 

**A Note on Web Performance**  
[In another post from early 2013](http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/the-numbers-behind-highered-rwd/), Erik notes many of the colleges and universities currently using responsive design have not taken the time to properly optimize performance for mobile sites.
